# React-Portfolio
![License badge](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?label=License&message=MIT&color=brightgreen)

## Description

This portoflio was written with react, as well the libraries Formik (form handling), email.js(email handling), and react-router-hash-link (handles  anchors and smooth scroll). I deviated from the challenge's design specifications because I preferred the single page look of the application without the singular component rendering. While I didn't use it extensively in this site, I am comfortable with the react router. I also did not include github and linkedin icons at the bottom. I reserved that space for a mailTo link with an svg icon. Instead I included external links to my github and linkedin in my navbar without icons to match the styling.
